Scratch!
This is the Problem Set 0 project for CS50. I am new to programming and thus there is bound to be errors. Feel free to offer advise or criticism!

I decided to create a small game for my first project. It is called "The Early Bird Catches the Worm" and involves two sets of sprites, the worms and the Robin. The aim of the game is to click 30 worms in order to win the game. 

You can play this game on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/179274168/)
